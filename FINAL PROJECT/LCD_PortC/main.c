This program utilizes internal and external interrupts to identify and sort objects of different material and colour. It consists of a main
loop which primarily has stepper motor control and DC motor control. Outside this, interrupt vectors contain flags which indicate that specific
conditions have been met allowing corresponding commands to be executed. It also uses functions such as ADC, internal timers, and a linkedlist.

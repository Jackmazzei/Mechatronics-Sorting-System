# Mechatronics-Sorting-System
Code for a high-performance MCU driven sorting system. The objective of the project was to successfully identify and sort 48 objects in under 60 seconds while minimizing time and errors. Finished with the 3rd fastest time and zero sorting errors
Note: for object to be sorted correctly, the object only needed to land in the correct bucket
